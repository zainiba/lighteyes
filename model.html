        Location Tracking has become so integrated in our lives, we don't think
        twice about apps asking for tracking permissions. Often in social media
        apps it is used as another method of connecting with others. When you
        share your location with others via social media, Find My Friends, or
        things of that sort you are allowing others to expirence those things
        with you. Sharing location with family or friends can give everyone
        peace of mind but it can also stimulate feelings of anxiety and
        obsession. Users began to rely heavily on technolgy that has limits to
        tell them where others are and when things began to go awry it can
        become an unhealthy fixation.
